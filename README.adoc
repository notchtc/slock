My personal https://tools.suckless.org/slock/[slock] build.

== Requirements
In order to build slock you need header files of:

- Xlib
- Xrandr
- imlib2

== Changes
This only uses the https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/foreground-and-background/[foreground and background] patch and changes the colors to tokyonight ones.

== Installation
Clone the repository and enter the directory.
[source,shell]
git clone https://github.com/notchtc/slock
cd slock

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):
[source,shell]
make clean install

== Running slock
Simply invoke the `slock` command. To get out of it, enter your password.
